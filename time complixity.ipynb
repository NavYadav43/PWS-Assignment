        "\n",
        "The time complexity of the `quicksort` function depends on the choice of pivot. In the worst case (when the pivot always divides the array into one very small subarray and one very large subarray), the time complexity is \\( O(n^2) \\). In the best case (when the pivot divides the array roughly in half), the time complexity is \\( O(n \\log n) \\).\n",

        "- In the function, you split the array into three parts: `left`, `middle`, and `right`.\n",
        "- Each split requires \\( O(n) \\) time because you are iterating through the entire array to partition it into these subarrays.\n",
        "- This splitting process repeats recursively for both `left` and `right` subarrays.\n",
